PDMChannel Library

Overview

The PDMChannel library is designed for controlling and monitoring power delivery channels using a MOSFET. It provides functionality for opening and closing channels, resetting them, and monitoring various parameters like voltage, current, and power.

Features

Control Mechanism: Offers methods to open, close, and reset power delivery channels.
State Management: Supports automatic and manual modes for channel management.
Monitoring: Provides functions to monitor voltage, current, maximum current, and power.
Configuration: Allows setting up the maximum current and opening time for each channel.
Installation

Clone this repository or download the source code.
Include the PDMChannel.h and PDMChannel.cpp files in your project directory.
Include the library in your project with #include "PDMChannel.h".
